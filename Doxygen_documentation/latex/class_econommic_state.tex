\subsection{Detailed Description}
\mbox{\hyperlink{class_this}{This}} class will be used to specify in which economic state the country is throughout the duration of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_war}{War}}.

There are three states in which a country can find itself\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rich}{Rich}}\+: Being in a rich state gives the country the benefit of upgrading its \mbox{\hyperlink{class_unit_factory}{Unit\+Factory}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_supply_factory}{Supply\+Factory}}. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_this}{This}} would increase the budget of the factories therefore making it possible to create more units and supplies giving them a greater advantage to winnning the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_war}{War}}.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_average}{Average}}\+: Being in an average state has the same advantages of being in a rich state except the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_country}{Country}} should be careful not to spend too much gdp since they are only in an average state.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_poor}{Poor}}\+: Being in a poor state has the disadvantage of not being able to upgrade factories. Therefore if the factories run out of budget then the country will not be able to create armies and send supplies to the armies. In this state the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_country}{Country}} has the option to surrender to the enemy.
\end{DoxyItemize}
